            <!-- <h2><strong>We Welcome You!</strong>
                    We know you have a lot of choices out there, and we‚Äôre so happy you chose your getaway with us! As it mentions in our listing, we‚Äôre the new kids on the block, so any feedback you have throughout your stay (or after), we‚Äôd love to hear it! Taking a break and getting away isn‚Äôt always easy, so we want to be sure your time at Michigami is everything you
                    dream, need, and want out of a vacation!
                    Michigami is what the Natives called Lake Michigan, meaning ‚ÄúGreat Water‚Äù. This particular area of Michigan was first land to the Potawatomi, and Peoria Tribes.

            <h2><strong>Important Things To Note</strong></h2>
            
                <h4>Check in time is 4:00pm EST</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Check out time is 11:00am EST</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>The code for front door will be sent the morning of check in, as it always changes with each guest.</h4>
                <h4>BYO chargers, bluetooth speaker, sunscreen, bugspray, and toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, soap etc</h4>
                <h4>We have internet,though, to be honest, it's speed is not what we're use to in the bigger cities, we're in the beautiful fruit farm country out here! Don't get me wrong, it works, it's just a little slower. I wouldn't plan on zoom meetings and streaming on multiple devices</h4>
                <h4>We have 3 televisions with Dish TV along with some premium channels.</h4>
                <h4>Our kitchen is fully stocked with pots/pans/baking sheets/ baking dishes, a blender, Keurig cup/filtered coffee combo, toaster, and microwave. No dishwasher, so bring paper plates if you plan on taking a vacation from doing dishes.</h4>
                <h4>Meijer is the nearest grocery store, the Glenn Store has wood, liquor, ice, snacks, pizza, and sandwiches</h4>
                <h4>We provide each guest with a beach towel.</h4>
                <h4> PIZZA!!  The Glenn Store just up the road (turn right on BlueStar Hwy stay for about 2 miles) has literally some of the best pizza I‚Äôve had, and I‚Äôm from Chicago. Thin crust is where it‚Äôs at. They also make great sandwiches. Across the street is Country Corner, breakfast anyone!?</h4>
                <h4>THE BEACH- this is an incredibly magical beach. Do know that it‚Äôs sandy, but entry into the lake is a bit rocky, so if you‚Äôre not one who‚Äôs steady on their feet, water shoes may be helpful, though the kids never seem to mind! DO NOT climb the eroding dunes as it‚Äôs incredibly dangerous. If you‚Äôre bringing your dog, please know they must be leashed and picked up after at all times, both on the property, for walks, and on the beach.</h4>
                <h4>Getting to the beach is easy peasy. Cross Blue Star Highway through the white gate. The code to the gate is 2391# at the second stop sign turn left. Make the first right down the hill. You have two options- drive 2 minutes and park right down by the lake in any of the designated spaces or walk 1‚ÅÑ2 mile- I will mention that the walk is BEAUTIFUL, though there is a BIG hill to walk down, which
                    may be a bit difficult if you‚Äôre lugging a bunch of stuff (particularly with small kids). It‚Äôs all paved whichever path you choose.</h4>
                <h4>I‚Äôm obligated to inform you that we have a Ring Doorbell which records the comings and goings and is that way for security purposes only.</h4>
                <h4>oop bags, food/water dishes, and a dog run if you‚Äôd like them to join you outside without having to hold onto their leash. We trust that you‚Äôll clean up after them, keep them leashed at all times, keep them off of the furniture and be respectful to the neighborhood when it comes to any excessive barking of the four-legged, or two-legged kind üòâ</h4>
                <h4>We have the yard and house sprayed for bugs to eliminate as many as possible, but there‚Äôs no magic solution, and they do still exist..Just not as many!</h4>
                <h4>Hot Tip! Turn the outdoor lights off at night when coming and going to avoid bugs coming in with you!</h4>
