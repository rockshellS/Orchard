                <h1>We Welcome You!
                    We know you have a lot of choices out there, and we’re so happy you chose your getaway with us! As it mentions in our listing, we’re the new kids on the block, so any feedback you have throughout your stay (or after), we’d love to hear it! Taking a break and getting away isn’t always easy, so we want to be sure your time at Michigami is everything you
                    dream, need, and want out of a vacation!
                    Michigami is what the Natives called Lake Michigan, meaning “Great Water”. This particular area of Michigan was first land to the Potawatomi, and Peoria Tribes.
